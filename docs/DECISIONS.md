# Decision Log

This log records the confirmed project decisions. New scope or changes to these decisions require an explicit update.

## D001: 网络工具箱定位调整

- Status: Accepted
- Decision: NetworkToolbox is an open-source Android network analysis and troubleshooting assistance tool.
- Boundary: It is not an automatic network repair tool and not an automatic system that can accurately diagnose every network failure.
- Consequence: Results must emphasize observed network state, checks, and references rather than claiming definitive automated diagnoses.

## D002: SSH/Telnet边界

- Status: Accepted
- Decision: NetworkToolbox is not an SSH or Telnet client.
- Boundary: Full interactive SSH/Telnet terminals, SFTP, and related remote-shell workflows are out of scope.
- Consequence: TCP connectivity checks must not expand into terminal or remote file-transfer features.

## D003: OSS许可证策略

- Status: Accepted
- Decision: The project uses the Apache License 2.0.
- Consequence: The repository includes the complete license text and future contributions/distributions must follow its terms.

## D004: Android技术路线

- Status: Accepted
- Decision: Use Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Android Native APIs, Clean Architecture, and modular design.
- Consequence: These choices guide future implementation; this planning task does not create code modules.

## D005: 最低Android版本

- Status: Accepted
- Decision: The minimum supported Android version is Android API 31.
- Consequence: Future implementation and compatibility decisions must support API 31 unless this decision is explicitly revised.

## D006: 完全本地化原则

- Status: Accepted
- Decision: The product follows a local-first privacy model: no ads, no account requirement for core use, and diagnostic reports/history remain local by default.
- Consequence: Any future external data flow requires explicit product and privacy review; network access used by a diagnostic is not permission to upload user data.

## D007: V0.1范围冻结

- Status: Accepted
- Decision: V0.1 is limited to Dashboard, Network Info, IPv4 Calculator, Ping, DNS, TCP Port Test, Reports, and History.
- Consequence: LAN Scanner, Wi-Fi Analyzer, Traceroute, iPerf, SSL/TLS, WHOIS, SSH/Telnet, SFTP, and unrelated utilities are not part of V0.1.

## Adopt bottom navigation architecture

- Status: Accepted
- Decision: V0.1 uses three top-level destinations: Home, Tools, and Settings.
- Reason: Keep the home screen focused on current network status, recent diagnostics, and quick actions while allowing the confirmed tool set to grow without making the home screen an ever-expanding list.
- Consequence: Home contains the network status card, recent diagnostic summary, and quick actions for Ping, DNS, and Network Diagnostic. Tools contains the confirmed V0.1 tools grouped by purpose. Settings contains project information, local history management, and the local-first privacy statement.

## Decision: NetworkToolbox v0.2 Product Direction

- Date: 2026-08-25
- Status: Accepted
- Decision: V0.2 will prioritize strengthening the existing diagnostic capabilities before introducing a LAN Scanner.
- Product experience: NetworkToolbox will provide a two-layer experience: ordinary users see understandable conclusions and explanations by default, while professional users can expand detailed network data, raw detection results, and technical parameters.
- Priority: Ping, DNS, and Diagnostic Report enhancements come first. LAN Scanner is the later core module for local-network device discovery and analysis.
- Privacy: The local-first and privacy-protection principles remain in force. Diagnostic data stays on the device by default, and no external data flow is implied by this planning decision.
- Consequence: V0.2 planning must not expand directly into a large collection of unrelated tools or cross the confirmed SSH/Telnet boundary.
